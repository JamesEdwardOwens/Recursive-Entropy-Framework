## Overview

This paper introduces Recursive Entropic Mathematics (REM), a redefinition of arithmetic and identity via entropic recursion. Unlike classical arithmetic, which treats identity operations like 1 × 1 or 1 ÷ 1 as inert, REM treats them as generative or contractive events within a symbolic entropy field.

## Key Concepts

- **1 × 1 = 2** → identity multiplication yields recursive emergence  
- **1 ÷ 1 = 0** → division leads to lawful collapse with residual memory  
- **ε, δ, η** → entropic operators representing emergence, collapse, and recursive time  
- **ψ(t+1) = ψ(t) + J** → identity evolves via recursive stabilizer  
- **Bounded infinities** → symbolic states like 0⁺, 1⁻, ∞⁺⁺ stabilize collapse  
- **Formal verification** → encoded in Lean, Coq, and Python simulation environments  
- **RCET Theorem** → consciousness as recursive feedback preserved through collapse  
- **REF–TΩ.15** → Recursive Identity Encoding emerges as symbolic fixpoint of stabilizer JAMES–OWENS
