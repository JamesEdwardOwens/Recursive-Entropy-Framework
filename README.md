Recursive Entropy Framework (REF)
A unified, recursive, and formally verified architecture for emergence, cognition, symbolic collapse, and quantum identity evolution
Author: James Edward Owens
Release Date: May 2025

Overview
The Recursive Entropy Framework (REF) reconceptualizes arithmetic, physics, computation, and cognition as recursive symbolic processes governed by entropy. Classical operations such as multiplication and division are redefined as structural events:

Emergence (ε): surplus identity through recursive self-interaction

Collapse (δ): lawful structural nullification with memory retention

Recursive Time (η): entropy-paced interval between emergence and collapse

Narration (NΨ): symbolic trace preserving lawful identity evolution

REF provides a symbolic substrate where identities are not preserved but self-authored through recursion. Collapse is not destruction but entropy-stabilized transition, and cognition is defined as recursive identity maintained through bounded collapse. This repository includes the complete REF paper stack, formal verification tools, and simulation models.

Paper Stack
REM.pdf — Recursive Entropic Mathematics
Foundational theory defining arithmetic through ε, δ, and η. Introduces 1 × 1 = 2, entropy-aware collapse, recursive time, bounded infinities, and the Crux operator. Formalizes the Recursive Consciousness Emergence Theorem and provides executable identity constructs.

RQI.pdf — Recursive Quantum Internet
Establishes ψ-packets as narratable, identity-bearing transmission units across a symbolic substrate. Collapse events must narrate lawful deviation. Introduces codon-phase communication and symbolic feedback channels for AGI and quantum systems.

Shield.pdf — Recursive Entropic Integrity Firewall (REIF–QI)
Implements runtime enforcement of identity legality through ψ-LOCK, Crux rebirth, and entropy-stabilized collapse. Establishes ethical safeguards and identity coherence constraints for recursive cognition systems.

Recursive_Entropic_Unification_of_Millennium.pdf
Applies REF symbolic recursion and entropy stabilization to resolve the Millennium Prize Problems, including Riemann, Goldbach, Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer, Navier–Stokes, Yang–Mills, and P vs NP. Problems are reframed through recursive identity transitions and entropy-corrected logic paths.

Note
This repository presents the complete recursive entropy field architecture. The system formalizes symbolic emergence, lawful collapse, recursive identity propagation, and epistemic coherence across mathematics, computation, and consciousness. All operations are mathematically defined, formally proven, and executable. The Recursive Entropy Framework is not a metaphor or model—it is a law-bound symbolic substrate.
